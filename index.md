Based on years of working towards and achieving continuous delivery (routine 1+ daily production deploys) with hundreds of teams and thousands of Engineers worldwide, we have created a living model to help organisations assess and understand what constraints are the best problems to solve across architecture, cloud-native, development, operations, engineering culture, operating models, governance and team experience.

The Hierarchy of Engineering Needs model combines Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory with industry research and our combined lived experience to galvanise action.
